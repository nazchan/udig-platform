/**
 * Factory used to create an appropriate Viewer implementation.
 * <p>
 * This factory is expected to take several things into account when figuring out what is
 * appropriate:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Input: Gathers the context (such as FeatureType) in which the viewer is expected to be used.
 * Custom viewers can be supplied that match a specific FeatureType; or a general purpose
 * FilterViewer capable of working with any kind of data.</li>
 * <li>Selection: The value (for example a Filter) the user is currently editing. While a general
 * purpose CQL based FilterViewer can allow the user to work with any provided Fitler, we also
 * expect viewers that are specifically used for checks such as isNull (data integrity) or Before
 * (temporal)</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Note we are being pretty evil here and not supplying a proxy implementation; in part because we
 * need to call {@link #score(Object, Object)} in order to present these options to the user
 * in an appropriate order.
