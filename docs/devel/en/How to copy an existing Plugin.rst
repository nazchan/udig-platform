How to copy an existing Plugin
==============================

#. File > Import
#. Select **Plugin Development** and **Plugins and Fragments** wizard, and press **Next**
#. On the right you can see EVERYTHING in the uDig SDK
#. Select a plugin that is similar to what you want to do:
   net.refractions.udig.catalog.world.image
#. Press **Add**
#. Press **Finish** to the plugin(s) into your workspace

From here you can hack away:

-  If you keep the plugin with the same name it will be used **INSTEAD** of the uDIG SDK entry
-  Or you can rename the plugin and use it as a good starting point for your own work
