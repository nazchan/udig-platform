3 Plugin Activator
==================

The **Activator** class is generated by the `create plug-in
wizard <1%20Creating%20a%20Plugin.html>`_ and is responsible for managing the life cycle of your
plugin.

The focus of the Activator class is Resource Management:

-  Internationalization support via `4 Plugin Internationalization with
   ResourceBundles <4%20Plugin%20Internationalization%20with%20ResourceBundles.html>`_
-  Management of system resources using utility classes like ImageCache, FontCache and so on
