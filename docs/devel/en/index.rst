Welcome to the uDig Developer's Guide. This guide is intended to help developers who want to
customize and build on top of the uDig core. uDig can be extended by adding standard Eclipse
plug-ins which work against either Eclipse or uDig extension points. Developers define their own
applications which combine existing and possibly new plug-ins.
