Simple Commands
===============

These are the workhorses of uDig application development, this is how to **do stuff**, and
interestingly **undo stuff**.

ICOmmand and IUndoable
----------------------

There are two basic categories of commands, a ***normal*** ICommand, which can not be undone and
when executed clears the undo stack, and **IUndoable** Commands, which can be undone and should be
used in as many cases as possible.

An example of a situation where is command can not be undone is a commit transaction command. Once a
transaction is committed it makes sense that it cannot be undone.

Code Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^

**AddLayerCommand.java**

::

    /**
     * Creates a command that adds a layer to the map.
     *

    public class AddLayerCommand extends AbstractCommand implements UndoableCommand {

        private Layer layer;
        private int index=-1;
        /**
         * Construct <code>AddLayerCommand</code>.
         *
         * @param layer the layer that will be added.
         */
        public AddLayerCommand(Layer layer) {
            this.layer=layer;
        }

        /**
         * Construct <code>AddLayerCommand</code>.
         *
         * @param layer the layer that will be added.
         * @param index the zorder that the layer will be added.
         */
        public AddLayerCommand(Layer layer, int index) {
            this.layer=layer;
            this.index=index;
        }

         * Remove the layer that was added during execution.
         * @see net.refractions.udig.project.command.UndoableCommand#rollback()
         */

         * framework protects against exceptions raised in commands.

         * Returns a copy of the command.  A command should only be executed once.  If the same
         * command is to be used multiple times the command should be copied.  Some commands
