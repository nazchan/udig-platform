Why a platform
==============

The Java GIS community is already host to several open-source toolkits of great capability. These
toolkits provide a great number of services, and allow you the software developer to communicate
with a wide varity of spatial information.

The UDIG framework goes the extra mile, providing a well structured application for you to extend.
As a software developer you can focus on your tasks needed for your problem. The finding, connecting
and display of spatial information can be someone else's problem.

Relationship with Libraries and Toolkits
----------------------------------------

You will find that uDig is set up as a platform allowing you to work "out of the box" with:

-  GeoAPI interfaces; these is a set of Java interfaces produced on commercial standards (provided
   by the Open Geospatial Consortium) and International standards (provided by the International
   Standards Origination)
-  GeoTools interfaces and implementation
-  JTS Toplogy Suite: provides the implementation of Geometry (ie the "Shapes") you see on the
   screen
-  ...
-  Your own own domain objects

This is by no means a closed set; community plug-ins have experimented with:

-  R for stats analysis
-  C libraries like GDAL and OGR
-  C++ libraries like OSSIM

If you hear of a good toolkit or library please ask on the email list; we would be happy to help you
hook it up.
