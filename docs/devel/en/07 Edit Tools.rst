Working with Edit Tools is a pretty advanced topic that brings together all your knowledge of uDig
development. Be kind to yourself and go through this material slowly, asking questions on the
developer list as needed.

Overview
========

The main purpose of Tools is to intercept events from the user and produce commands to modify the
data model.

Use of Blackboard
-----------------

The layer black board is always used as a place for plug-in collaboration. While the blackboard is
often used to store simple data, it can also be used to store complete Objects (with their own
functionality and event system).

The Edit Tools framework uses the layer blackboard in this manner, to store an entire object:

::

    EditBlackboard editBlackboard = layer.getBlackboard().get(EditBlackboardUtil.EDIT_BLACKBOARD_KEY);

The **EditBlackboard** is used to gather up changes provided by the Edit Tools. We are going to move
on to the details now, please keep this overview on how tool / layer / command collaboration works
in mind.

.. figure:: /images/07_edit_tools/EditBlackboard.png
   :align: center
   :alt: 

Use of IProvider
----------------

The **IProvider** interface is really just used to capture the idea of a pointer or proxy to a
value. It represents a promises that a value of the
 expected type will be available when asked.

The Edit Tool Framework makes use of:

-  IProvider<Cursor> to provide a cursor when and if needed
-  IProvider<String> to provide a message when and if needed

Edit Tool Framework
===================

The central classes in the editing framework are the **AbstractEditTool**, **EditToolHandler**,
**EditBlackboard** classes.

AbstractEditTool
----------------

Edit Tools literally are an extention of SimpleTool (that is they have a right click "context"
menu), that delegate their functionality to a small "engine" called EditToolHandler. The
AbstractEditTool has little functionality beyond configuring the **EditToolHandler** object upon
creation.

.. figure:: /images/07_edit_tools/EditTool.GIF
   :align: center
   :alt: 

AbstractEditTool implementations are responsible implementing several **init** methods that are used
when configuring the EditToolHandler for use.

-  initEnablementBehaviours(List<EnablementBehaviour>) - define when a tool is enabled
-  initActivators(Set<Activator>) - activate and deactivate a tool
-  initAcceptBehaviours(List<Behaviour>) - define how a tool completes its work
-  initCancelBehaviours(List<Behaviour>) - define how a tool cancels its work
-  initEventBehaviours(EditToolConfigurationHelper) - define how the tools responds to events

You will notice that each one of these methods is provided with a configuration object (a List or
EditToolConfigurationHelper) which it can fill in.

You can think of these methods as provided a simple scripting language which is used to describe
what the tool is capable of.

EditToolHandler
---------------

Edit Tool handler operates as an "engine" that will dispatch the incoming events to any active
Behaviors; it is responsble for holding the "state" of the AbstractEditTool including the cursor and
any draw commands providing visual feedback.

.. figure:: /images/07_edit_tools/EditToolHandler.GIF
   :align: center
   :alt: 

The EditToolHandler:

-  is composed of **EventBehaviours**, **Activators** and **AcceptBehaviours** as shown above.
-  accepts mouse and keyboard events from the **AbstractEditTool** and delegates the events to
   "EventBehaviour\* objects that are valid for the type of event. All **EventBehaviour** objects
   that are valid will have the commands returned by their getCommand() method sent to the map's
   commandStack for execution.
-  **Activators** are ran when the tool is activated and deactivated.
-  **AcceptBehaviours** are ran when the tool is deactivated, when a behaviour requests that the
   current changes be accepted or when the user presses "Enter" key.
-  has a locking mechanism so that a group of **EventBehaviours** can lock out other potentially
   valid behaviours.
    For example a move vertex behaviour (Valid during drag events) may wish to lock the handler so
   that the SelectVertexBox behaviour (Also valid during drag events) is not disturbed.
-  The current geometry and shape (shell or hole) being edited can be accessed throught the
   **EditToolHandler**
-  Use **MouseTracker** if you want to inspect the queue of previous events, current point and so on
-  The current edit state can be accessed via the **EditToolHandler**. The possible edit states are
   listed in the enum **EditState**.

EditBlackBoard
--------------

The Edit Blackboard is used as a scratch pad for EditTools to collaborate; literally it is used to
hold on to any selected Features (each selected Feature is represented as an **EditGeom**. You can
switch between tools, each of which will interact with the EditBlackBoard in a different manner.

.. figure:: /images/07_edit_tools/EditBlackBoard.GIF
   :align: center
   :alt: 

The main responsibility of the EditBlackboard is to provide methods for efficiently editing
geometries. To that effect:

-  Geometries can be added to the blackboard and vertices can be added, removed and moved by making
   requests to the **EditBlackboard**. When a Geometry is added to the **EditBlackboard** it is
   converted into one or more **EditGeom** objects. All editing is done in terms of pixels, the
   **EditBlackboard** will transparently perform a requested operation on all coordinates mapping to
   the pixel(s) and will handle all the transformations required.
-  The EditBlackboard also has a **Selection** which is a selection of points and Coordinates at
   that point. When the Selection is obtained it is a snap shot of the selection at that point in
   time. If a reference is maintained to a selection and a point is added to the selection via the
   methods on the **EditBlackboard** the referenced Selection will not change. **HOWEVER**, if a
   point is moved on the EditBlackboard the selection will be updated to reflect the move.
   Similarly, if a point is removed from the **EditBlackboard** the point (and all associated
   coordinates) will be removed from the selection. It is important to not keep references to
   **Selections** any longer than necessary because **Selections** will receive events as long as
   they are referenced. The **EditBlackboard**'s list of listeners are weak references so all that
   needs to be done to remove a listener from the **EditBlackboard** is to remove all references to
   the object. That is also a warning. If an object is listening to the **EditBlackboard** it is
   important to keep a reference to the listener.
-  The **EditBlackboard** can be useful for implementing coverage-like editing. If two geometries
   are added to the **EditBlackboard** that share an edge; edits moving one of the shared vertices
   will automatically move the coordinates in both geometries.

EditGeom
~~~~~~~~

Represents a selected Feature on the EditBlackboard, while this sounds like a simple responsibility
the reality is a bit more complicated in that visual feedback and interaction requires a **very**
fast response. As such the EditGeom maintains a bunch of cached information (usually simplifications
of the original Geometry) in order to respond quickly to mouse clicks.

.. figure:: /images/07_edit_tools/EditGeom.GIF
   :align: center
   :alt: 

In the above diagram you can see a little bit of the "cached information" in the form of:

-  PrimitiveShape -
-  PointCoordMap - Maps from a Point to a list of LazyCoord represented by that Point
-  Point - an x,y location on the screen that can be compared using the \\=\\= operator for speed
-  LazyCoord - an implementation of JTS Coordinate that has been transformed; will not actually
   calculate the final value until needed

Tool Lifecycle
==============

**AbstractEditTool.initEnablementBehaviours** is used to define when the tools should be enabled for
use.

Here is an example from the PointTool:

::

    protected void initEnablementBehaviours( List<EnablementBehaviour> helper ) {
            helper.add(new WithinLegalLayerBoundsBehaviour());
            helper.add(new ValidToolDetectionActivator(new Class[]{Geometry.class, Point.class, MultiPoint.class}));
        }

**initActivators** is used to provide a list of things to do when the tool is enabled and disabled.

Here is an example from the PointTool:

::

    protected void initActivators( Set<Activator> activators ) {
            activators.add(new EditStateListenerActivator());
            activators.add(new DeleteGlobalActionSetterActivator());
            activators.add(new DrawGeomsActivator(DrawGeomsActivator.DrawType.POINT));
            activators.add(new DrawCurrentGeomVerticesActivator());
            activators.add(new SetSnapBehaviourCommandHandlerActivator());
            activators.add(new AdvancedBehaviourCommandHandlerActivator());
            activators.add(new SetRenderingFilter());
            activators.add(new GridActivator());
        }

EnablementBehaviour
-------------------

An EnablementBehaviour is a callback object invoked by EditToolHandler to check if the tool can be
used at the present time. Please note that this callback object will return a String to be used in
the status bar; or null if everything is okay.

.. figure:: /images/07_edit_tools/EnablementBehavior.GIF
   :align: center
   :alt: 

Activator
---------

An activator is a simple callback object invoked by the EditToolHandler to wire the edit tool
framework up to the application (using listeners, providing draw commands for visual feedback and so
forth):

-  AbstractEditTool.setActive( boolean ) is called
-  AbstractEditTool.setContext( IToolContext ) is called

.. figure:: /images/07_edit_tools/Activator.GIF
   :align: center
   :alt: 

In practice an Activator is used in a manner similar to a Runnable to wire the application together
- examples include:

-  listening to the data model (responsible for FeatureStore events)
-  listening to the "EditManager" (responsible for the commit / revert workflow)
-  listening to the EditBlackboard and adding/invalidating DrawGeomsCommands as needed for visual
   feedback
-  adding a Grid to the Map for snapping
-  and so on...

Tool Functionality
==================

**initAcceptsBehaviours** lists ways in which the tool knows a feature is "Accepted" and ready to be
sent to the FeatureStore. The **AcceptChangesBehaviour** is bound to a double click action or the
"Enter" key being pressed. You may also consider the **DeslectEditShapeAcceptBehaviour** to accept a
change when the user moves on to a different feature.

Here is an example from the PointTool:

::

    protected void initAcceptBehaviours( List<Behaviour> acceptBehaviours ) {
            acceptBehaviours.add( new AcceptChangesBehaviour(Point.class, false) );
            acceptBehaviours.add( new DeselectEditShapeAcceptBehaviour() );
        }

**initCancelBehaviors** lists way for a tool to know that modifications to a feature are "Canceled"
and should be thrown out.

Here is an example from the PointTool:

::

    protected void initCancelBehaviours( List<Behaviour> cancelBehaviours ) {
            cancelBehaviours.add(new DefaultCancelBehaviour());
        }

Behaviour
---------

Functionality used by the EditToolHandler if the **isValid** method returns true.

.. figure:: /images/07_edit_tools/Behaviour.GIF
   :align: center
   :alt: 

Example implementations:

-  **AcceptChangesBehaviour** is bound to a double click action or the "Enter" key being pressed.
-  **DeslectEditShapeAcceptBehaviour** to accept a change when the user moves on to a different
   feature.
-  **DefaultCanelBehaviour** is based on the "Clear Selection" menu bar command, or the "Esc" key
   being pressed.

Event Handling
==============

The **initEventBehaviours** captures how the AbstractEditTool interacts with the user. Rather than a
simple list, a EditToolConfigurationHelper object is provided for you to fill in. You can treat this
method like a small scripting language in which you can define alternative functionality based on
what the user is doing (say if the user is over top of a vertex you may want to move the vertex
rather than create a new point).

Here is an example from the PointTool:

::

    protected void initEventBehaviours( EditToolConfigurationHelper helper ) {
            helper.add( new DrawCreateVertexSnapAreaBehaviour());
            helper.add(new StartEditingBehaviour(ShapeType.POINT));
            helper.add( new AcceptBehaviour() );
            helper.add( new SetSnapSizeBehaviour());
            helper.done();
       }

EventBehaviour
--------------

EventBehaviour is literally the point of the edit tool framework; it is responsible for turning
events into commands. Implementations exist for a range of activities; and you are free to make your
own.

.. figure:: /images/07_edit_tools/EventBehaviour.GIF
   :align: center
   :alt: 

**EventBehaviour** is called when when events are raised by the mouse or keyboard. All
**EventBehaviours** have an *isValid()* method that is called to determine whether or not the
behaviour is can be used given the current state of the **EditToolHandler** and and the type of
event that occurred. If the **EventBehaviour** is valid then the *getCommand()* method will be
called by the **EditToolHandler** and executed by the current map's command manager. Since both
*isValid()* and *getCommand()* are executed in the display thread the amount of work they do must be
very quickly executed so as to not impact the user interaction.

\*EventBehaviour.isValid() is used to determine the behavior is applicable or can be used.

Here is an example from AcceptBehaviour:

::

    public boolean isValid( EditToolHandler handler, MapMouseEvent e, EventType eventType ) {
        boolean legalState=handler.getCurrentState()==EditState.CREATING;
        boolean legalEventType=eventType==EventType.RELEASED;
        boolean shapeAndGeomNotNull=handler.getCurrentShape()!=null;
        boolean button1Released=e.button==MapMouseEvent.BUTTON1;

        return legalState && legalEventType && shapeAndGeomNotNull && button1Released && !e.buttonsDown() && !e.modifiersDown();
    }

**getCommand()** is called to turn the provided event into an UndoableMapCommand that will be
executed on your behalf:

Here is an example from AcceptBehaviour:

::

    public UndoableMapCommand getCommand( EditToolHandler handler, MapMouseEvent e, EventType eventType ) {
        if( !isValid(handler, e, eventType) )
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Current state is not legal"); //$NON-NLS-1$

        List<UndoableMapCommand> commands=new ArrayList<UndoableMapCommand>();
        commands.add(handler.getCommand(handler.getAcceptBehaviours()));
        if( handler.getCurrentState()==EditState.CREATING)
            commands.add(new SetEditStateCommand(handler, EditState.MODIFYING));
        UndoableComposite undoableComposite = new UndoableComposite(commands);
        undoableComposite.setMap(handler.getContext().getMap());
        try {
            undoableComposite.run(new NullProgressMonitor());
        } catch (Exception e1) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e1);
        }
        return new UndoRedoCommand(undoableComposite);
    }

Finally **handleError** is used to provide feedback in the case of an exception; feedback can range
from a pop up bubble to a simple log message:

::

    public void handleError( EditToolHandler handler, Throwable error, UndoableMapCommand command ) {
       EditPlugin.log( "Could not move vertex", error); //$NON-NLS-1$
    }

EditToolConfigurationHelper
---------------------------

This class is where all the "fun" comes into the edit tool framework; the use of this class when
implementing **AbstractEditTool.initEventBehaviours** is where you seriously get to customize and
define what the user experience is.

You can **add()** a Behaviour to an EditToolConfigurationHelper in a manner similar to a list; and
call **done()** at the end of your script:

::

    helper.add( new DrawCreateVertexSnapAreaBehaviour());
    helper.add(new StartEditingBehaviour(ShapeType.POINT));
    helper.add( new AcceptBehaviour() );
    helper.add( new SetSnapSizeBehaviour());
    helper.done();

Ordered List
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can define list of behaviours to execute in order. This operates in a manner similar to a series
of statements in a programming language.

By default behaviours are processed in the DisplayThread:

::

    helper.startOrderedList();
    helper.add( ... step one ... );
    helper.add( ... step two... );
    helper.stopOrderedList();

Behaviours executed in the display thread should not perform **any** I/O and should be used for
quick updates to the model only.

You can also ask for the behaviours to be run in the command thread:

::

    helper.startOrderedList( true );
    helper.add( ... step one ... );
    helper.add( ... step two... );
    helper.stopOrderedList();

This is useful when earlier commands change state required by later commands; or if any I/O is
required.

Mutually Exclusive List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can define a mutually exclusive list of behaviours (only the first one that is valid will be
used) using the following syntax:

::

    helper.startMutualExclusiveList();
    helper.add( new SelectVertexOnMouseDownBehaviour() );
    helper.add( new SelectVertexBehaviour() );
    helper.add( new SelectFeatureBehaviour( ... ));
    helper.stopMutualExclusiveList();

This operates in a manner similar to a series of if / then / elseif statements in a programming
language.

Advanced Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can define "advanced features" using the following syntax:

::

    helper.add( ..normal behaviour... )
    helper.startAdvancedFeatures();
    helper.add( ...behaviour for advanced mode only... );
    helper.stopAdvancedFeatures();

You can also include an optional section of "else features" that will only be included in normal
mode:

::

    helper.add( ..normal behaviour... )
    helper.startAdvancedFeatures();
    helper.add( ...behaviour for advanced mode only... );
    helper.startElseFeatures();
    helper.add( ...behaviour for normal mode only... );
    helper.stopElseFeatures();
    helper.stopAdvancedFeatures();

The idea of Advanced Features acts as a big switch the user can throw as a Windows > Preference
setting. You can consider this switch as a toggle; when it is enabled EditToolConfiguration will
read in one configuration

Consider the previous example of PointTool; if we wanted to make an advanced PointTool that in
addition to creating points could also select existing points and move them we would have a script
like this:

::

    helper.add( new DrawCreateVertexSnapAreaBehaviour());
    helper.add( new CursorControlBehaviour( .. ));

    helper.startMutualExclusiveList(); // choose the first one that works
      helper.add( new SelectVertexOnMouseDownBehaviour() );
      helper.add( new SelectVertexBehaviour() );
      helper.add( new SelectFeatureBehaviour( ... ));
    helper.stopMutualExclusiveList();

    helper.add( new MoveVertexBehaviour() );
    helper.add( new AcceptBehaviour() );
    helper.add( new SetSnapSizeBehaviour());
    helper.done();

We can combine both ideas using a single script:

::

    helper.add( new DrawCreateVertexSnapAreaBehaviour());

            {   helper.startAdvancedFeatures();
                ConditionalProvider defaultMessage = new ConditionalProvider( handler, Messages.PointTool_select_or_create_feature,Messages.PointTool_add_vertex_or_finish);
                CursorControlBehaviour.SystemCursorProvider overVertexCursor = new CursorControlBehaviour.SystemCursorProvider(SWT.CURSOR_SIZEALL);
                ConditionalProvider overVertexMessage = new ConditionalProvider( handler, Messages.PointTool_move_vertex,null );
                CursorControlBehaviour.SystemCursorProvider overEdgeCursor = new CursorControlBehaviour.SystemCursorProvider(SWT.CURSOR_CROSS);
                ConditionalProvider overEdgeMessage = new ConditionalProvider( handler, Messages.PointTool_add_vertex, null);
                helper.add(
                        new CursorControlBehaviour(
                                handler,
                                defaultMessage,
                                overVertexCursor,
                                overVertexMessage,
                                overEdgeCursor,
                                overEdgeMessage
                        )
                );
                helper.stopAdvancedFeatures();
            }

            // vertex selection OR geometry selection should not both happen so make them a mutual exclusion behaviour
            {   helper.startMutualExclusiveList();
                {   helper.startAdvancedFeatures();
                    helper.add( new SelectVertexOnMouseDownBehaviour() );
                    helper.add( new SelectVertexBehaviour() );

                    SelectFeatureBehaviour selectGeometryBehaviour = new SelectFeatureBehaviour(new Class[]{Point.class, MultiPoint.class}, BBOX.class);
                    selectGeometryBehaviour.initDefaultStrategies(ShapeType.POINT);
                    helper.add(selectGeometryBehaviour);

                    {   helper.startElseFeatures();
                        helper.add(new StartEditingBehaviour(ShapeType.POINT));
                        helper.stopElseFeatures();
                    }
                    helper.stopAdvancedFeatures();
                }
                helper.stopMutualExclusiveList();
            }
            {   helper.startAdvancedFeatures();
                helper.add( new MoveVertexBehaviour() );
                helper.stopAdvancedFeatures();
            }
            helper.add( new AcceptBehaviour() );
            helper.add( new SetSnapSizeBehaviour());
            helper.done();
        }

Commands
--------

The point of an **EventBehavior** is to set up some (usually undoable) commands for the system to
perform.

Selection Command Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Selecting feature content is an interesting enough problem that there is a ready made
**SelectFeaturesAtPointCommand** ready to leap into action.

.. figure:: /images/07_edit_tools/selection.GIF
   :align: center
   :alt: 

To customize the functionality of this Selection command (or your own selection command). You can
make use of the following:

-  **SelectParameter**
-  **SelectStratagy** a callback object that will be run as a feature is selected
-  **DeselectionStratagy**

For more information please review the **net.refractions.udig.tutorials.tool.coverage**
implementation of a selection command that works on a single feature while selecting its neighbors
as well.

Here is an example selection parameter taken from the above tutorial:

::

    protected void initEventBehaviours( EditToolConfigurationHelper helper ) {
            helper.startMutualExclusiveList();
            helper.add(new SelectVertexOnMouseDownBehaviour());
            helper.add(new SelectVertexBehaviour());
            SelectFeatureBehaviour selectFeatureBehaviour =
                new SelectFeatureBehaviour(new Class[]{Geometry.class}, Intersects.class );
            selectFeatureBehaviour.addSelectionStrategy(new SelectNeightborsStrategy());

            helper.add(selectFeatureBehaviour);
            helper.stopMutualExclusiveList();

            helper.add( new MoveVertexBehaviour() );

            helper.done();
        }

IEditValidator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When manipulating feature content it is really easy to make something that is invalid (say a polygon
with a "hole" that crosses the edge of the polygon). While it is easy to catch this problem at the
end of the day (when accept behaviours churn through your edit black board and fail when creating a
geometry) it is much nicer to provide an immediate check and let the user know something is wrong.

.. figure:: /images/07_edit_tools/edit_validator.GIF
   :align: center
   :alt: 

The class will return a String consisting of the error message.

The **IEditValidator** interface defines a single **isValid** method; the implementation here is an
example from PolygonCreationValidator:

::

    public String isValid( EditToolHandler handler, MapMouseEvent event, EventType type ) {
            PrimitiveShape shell = handler.getCurrentShape();
            Point newPoint = Point.valueOf(event.x, event.y);

            int lastPointIndex = shell.getNumPoints()-1;
            if( shell.getNumPoints()>2 && EditUtils.instance.intersection(shell.getPoint(lastPointIndex), newPoint, shell, 0, lastPointIndex) ){
                return Messages.ValidHoleValidator_selfIntersection;
            }
            return null;
        }

The following implementations are provided out of the box:

-  IEditValidator.TRUE - class constant that is always valid
-  LegalShapeValidator - will fail if a geometry could not be created from the edit blackboard
-  PolygonCreationValidator
-  ValidHoleValidator

You will want to make your own implementation when providing immediate feedback on additional
restrictions.

Pop-up Bubbles Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When changing snapping behavior; or failing a validation check you can see feedback in the form of
little pop-up bubbles. Here is how this is done for MoveVertexBehavior when a validation fails.

::

    private void openErrorBubble( EditToolHandler handler, MapMouseEvent e, String errorMessage ) {
        MessageBubble bubble=new MessageBubble(e.getPoint().x, e.getPoint().y, errorMessage,
                        PreferenceUtil.instance().getMessageDisplayDelay() );
        AnimationUpdater.runTimer(handler.getContext().getMapDisplay(), bubble);

Note the positioning of the bubble right at the location the user just gave us - making sure they
notice the feedback.

Listeners
---------

Edit Manager listener
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To catch what is created with udig edit tools, you can add a listener to the Edit Manager. You have
to test whether the created  feature's schema is the same as what you expect.

::

       map.getEditManager().addListener(new IEditManagerListener() {             
          public void changed(EditManagerEvent event) {
             if(map.getEditManager().getEditLayer()!=null && map.getEditManager().getEditLayer().equals(myLayer)) {
                SimpleFeature feature = map.getEditManager().getEditFeature();
                if(feature != null) {
                   if(feature.getFeatureType().equals(myFeatureType)) {
                      // The new feature
          }}}}
       });

You can also store the udig feature store by adding a listener to your layer.

::

    myLayer.addListener(new ILayerListener() {
          public void refresh(LayerEvent event) {
             if(event.getNewValue() instanceof FeatureEvent) {
                FeatureEvent newEvent = (FeatureEvent) event.getNewValue();
                   if(newEvent.getSource() instanceof FeatureStore) {
                      udigStore = (FeatureStore<SimpleFeatureType, SimpleFeature>) newEvent.getSource();
                   }
                }
              }
       });

Layer listener
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To catch what is selected/deselected with udig select tools, you have to add a listener to your
layer.

::

    myLayer.addListener(new ILayerListener() {
          public void refresh(LayerEvent event) {
             if(event instanceof LayerEvent) {
                if(event.getType().equals(EventType.FILTER)) {
                   if(!event.getNewValue().equals(event.getOldValue())) {
                      if( event.getNewValue() instanceof FidFilterImpl) {
                         FidFilterImpl uDigfilter = (FidFilterImpl) event.getNewValue();
                         try {
                            SimpleFeature selectedFeature = myStore.getFeatures(uDigfilter).features().next();        
                         } catch (Exception e) {
                            e.printStackTrace();
                         }
                       }
                       else {
                          if(map.getEditManager().getEditFeature() == null)
                             // no feature selected                                        
                       }
                    }
                 }
              }
            }
         });

Archived Edit Tool Docs
=======================

Edit tools are another sub-type of tools, however they do not (yet) have their own extension point.
Instead they are extensions of the net.refractions.udig.project.ui.tool extension point. Because
there are a large number of editing tools that can be created an many of them have similar
functionality there is a little framework associated with edit tools development.
