What to Do Next
===============

Here are some additional challenges for you to try. Each of these ideas results in a more professional looking application.

* Manually add the **jre** folder from the SDK Quickstart to the generated **custom-1.0.0.zip** file. 
  This will let users of your application unzip and run.


* Try a wider **about.gif** image and see what that looks like.

* Try making window icons with a transparent section.

* The eclipse Search (:kbd:`CTRL` + :kbd:`H`) can be used find all the available action sets.

  Try a Plug-in Search with the following parameters.

  Add a new perspective extension actionSet to get the 'Change Style...' layer menu entry shown below.

  .. hint::
     Use the :guilabel:`browse` button when adding an ActionSet.


* Add an “intro part” to your application to welcome new users.

  Remember to search in the eclipse help menu for documentation on how to do this – yes 
  it is even better then trying to use google or koders.


* Add branding to the net.refractions.udig_tutorials.custom-feature feature. This is how 
  you can get your organization's name included in the about box.


* Externalize all the translatable strings in the **plugin.xml** and the **custom.product**. 

  You can also create language specific splash.bmp and about.gif images.

* Advanced: Perform a build from the command line, eclipse help has the details.
