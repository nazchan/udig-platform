Plugin Dependencies
===================

The plug-in MANIFEST.MF file is used to define the requirements and capabilities of any plug-in. You will recognize a lot of the information here from when you defined the plug-in.

* Open the MANIFEST.MF file:

* Switch to the Dependencies tab.

* Press the :guilabel:`Add` button in the Required Plug-ins section.

* Select the net.refractions.udig.ui plug-in and press :guilabel:`OK`.
  
  .. tip::
     You can start typing \*.udig.ui to quickly filter the list.

* Select :menuselection:`File --> Save` from the menu bar to save the file.

  This step is important as it gives the MANIFEST.MF a chance to generate:


  * The **.classpath** file used by the Java build system

  * The **.project** file used by the IDE


  .. note::
     The classpath used for compiling is updated to include jars provided by the dependencies.


* With this information in place the wizards and dialogs we used in the next section will be able to find 
  classes defined by the **net.refractions.udig.ui** plug-in.
