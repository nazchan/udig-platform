Introduction
============

In this workbook we are going to create a custom application based on uDig GIS platform.

We will learn how to:

* Specify branding elements such as splash screen and title


* Declare how components in the application will be organized


* Package up the application for others to download and use


We will be making use of the development environment created in the first workbook. If you also have completed the Distance Tool Plug-in you can include it in your application.
