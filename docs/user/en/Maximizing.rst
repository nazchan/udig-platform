Maximizing
----------

Sometimes it is useful to be able to maximize a view or editor. Maximizing both views and editors is
easy.

#. To maximize a view, either double click on its tab or choose **Maximize** from the tab's popup
   menu.
#. To maximize an editor, double click on the editor tab or choose **Maximize** from the tab's popup
   menu.
#. Restoring a view to its original size is done in a similar manner (double click or choose
   **Restore** from the menu).
