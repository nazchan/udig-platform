Feature Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The concept of a Feature Type is used to name and describe set of vector data (known as a Feature
Collection). This terminology comes from the Web Feature Server specification; which is a web
service that publishes the definition of a feature types; along with vector data that matches that
type.

A Feature Type consists of several interesting parts:

-  a type name - this is the name of the content; it could be as informal as the filename that
   contains the content; or it could be a formal name provided the organization making the
   information available.
-  attribute types; describe the information recorded about the features
-  a default geometry; this is the geometry that is drawn on the map (unless you are more specific)

You can think of a feature collection as being the data; and the feature type as being a description
of that data.
