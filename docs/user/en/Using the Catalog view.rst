The catalog view is used to show spatial information currently in use by the application. The
catalog view shows information divided up by:

-  Service: Examples of services include Web Features Servers, Databases, and Filenames
-  Layers: Layers include the contents of a shapefile, individual layers from a Web Map Server, or
   syntheic layers such as a scalebar
