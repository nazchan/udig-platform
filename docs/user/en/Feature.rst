Feature
~~~~~~~

A Feature literally represents something that can be drawn onto a map. Features may represent real
world objects like a building; or be abstract such as voting districts.

When more than one feature of the same type exist; you can group them into a feature collection;
each feature is said to belong to a feature type.
