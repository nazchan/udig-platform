What to do Next
===============

If you finish early here are some challenges.

* The “Sample Requests” demo lets you try out requests one at a time by selecting them from a List and hitting Submit.
  Try out a GetFeature request by hand.
  Try out WMS GetCapabilities and confirm the title is as you defined it.


* Turn down the amount of logging to let GeoServer run faster


* Advanced: Have a look at the “open layers” link for the Tasmania layer preview. Can you explain what trick Geoserver is doing.


How can you use GeoServer in your organisation?
